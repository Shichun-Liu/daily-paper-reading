**Definition 3**. (Natural language reasoning). Natural language reasoning is a pro-
cess of integrating multiple knowledge (e.g., encyclopedic knowledge and commonsense
knowledge) to derive some new conclusions about the (realistic or hypothetical) world.
Knowledge can be derived from sources that are both explicit and implicit. Conclusions
are assertions or events assumed to be true in the world, or practical action.
